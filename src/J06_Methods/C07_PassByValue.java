/*
    One thing I learned here is that Java is always
    pass by value.

    For primitive data types, a copy of the actual value
    is passed to the method.

    For objects, a copy of the reference is passed.
    That's why we can change the object's data inside
    the method, but if we assign the reference to a new
    object, the original object remains unchanged.

    So Java does not support true pass by reference.
